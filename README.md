# PythonNeuralNetwork

## Welcome to my implementation of a basic neural network in the Python programming language
This project is a fork of Tariq Rashid's implementation of a handwriting recognition program as detailed in his book 'Make Your Own Neural Network'
This implementation can be run as a Jupyter notebook.

The dataset can be downloaded from the MNIST website. Two samples have been provided, but the code will need to be adjusted.

## Enjoy
